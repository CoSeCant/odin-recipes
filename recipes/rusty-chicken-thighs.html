            <li>2 teaspoons of Asian chile pepper sauce</li>
            <li>1.5 tablespoons of maple syrup</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of mayonnaise</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of rice vinegar</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>Pinch of freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 pounds of skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1 lime, cut into ~8 wedges</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mash garlic to a paste with a mortar and pestle. 
                Mix chile pepper sauce, maple syrup, soy sauce, mayonnaise, 
                and rice vinegar into garlic until marinade is thoroughly 
                combined.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken thighs to a large flat container 
                (such as a baking dish) and pour marinade over chicken; 
                stir until chicken is coated. Cover dish with plastic wrap 
                and refrigerate about 3 hours; if preferred, let stand about 
                30 minutes at room temperature. Unwrap dish and sprinkle with 
                salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat charcoal grill to high heat.</li>
            <li>Place chicken thighs onto the hot grill with smooth sides 
                down. Cook until chicken shows grill marks, about 3 minutes. 
                Turn chicken over and cook until other side shows grill marks, 
                about 5 minutes. Continue to cook, moving them occasionally 
                and turning over every 2 minutes, until meat is no longer pink 
                inside and the thighs are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a platter, let rest for 5 minutes, 
                and serve garnished with lime wedges.</li>
        </ol>
